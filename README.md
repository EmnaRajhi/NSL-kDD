# NSL-KDD Supervised Machine Learning Notebook

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning techniques on the NSL-KDD dataset. The NSL-KDD dataset is widely used in the field of network intrusion detection. 
The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify network traffic as either normal or malicious.

## Dataset

The NSL-KDD dataset is used in this project, which is a refined version of the original KDD Cup 99 dataset.
It includes labeled data for both normal and attack instances, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks.
